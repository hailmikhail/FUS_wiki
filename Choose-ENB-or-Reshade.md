# Choose ENB or Reshade
From MO2, run the ENB \ Reshade program:

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about "Failed to check for update". This is ok.

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

Now here, you can choose from a list of different ENB/Reshade profiles. There are 3 difference performance indicators in their names. Low means low performance cost, Medium means medium performance cost and High means high performance cost. 
If any preset was marked as on, then turn them off, then turn on the selection of your choice. By default, The first option is checked. Uncheck this and then check any of the other options that you would like to test.

The best option for low performance impact but high visual gains including a sharp image is the **VRVision** reshade option. 

**IMPORTANT:** If you want to use the Sensorium ENB you need to change the ini using Bilago's Tool (start from MO2 in the dropdown): set `bUseFilmicCurve=0`. Probably also a good idea for the other ENBs although they don't explicitly demand it. Don't forget to switch it back on when choosing a Reshade again.
