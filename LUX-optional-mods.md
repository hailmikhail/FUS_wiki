# LUX LUMINANCE - MORE BRIGHTNESS - DIVERSE OPTIONS

There are several files that have been made to adjust brightness for lux. This means interiors as well as dungeons. Everything has been done simply in SSEEdit adjusting RGB vallues.
The template DarkSynth made was upping the Y+/Y- and X+/X- RGB vallues with +30 under DALC in SSEEdit in the playerhomes templates only. 
The first number meaning the homes and the second meaning the dungeon templates.
