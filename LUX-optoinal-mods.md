# LUX LUMINANCE - MORE BRIGHTNESS - DIVERSE OPTIONS

Credits go to DarkSynth which I have been in contact with for a bit who made the lux template bright up. 
This inspired me to make more edits. This is for those who are using a darker ENB and love LUX or want to try out LUX but find it a bit too dark.

There are several files that have been made to adjust brightness for lux. This means interiors as well as dungeons. Everything has been done simply in SSEEdit adjusting RGB vallues.
The template DarkSynth made was upping the Y+/Y- and X+/X- RGB vallues with +30 under DALC in SSEEdit in the playerhomes templates only. 
The first number meaning the homes and the second meaning the dungeon templates.


 ||============||
||  !!UPDATE!!  ||
 ||============||
 
1.1) Added a single extra template, the 'obscure' template. This is only for the 30XX, 3010, 2010 and 10XX versions. Added a 5050 version.
1.2) Added new versions; a 1010 version and a 4040 version. Rechecked the template for the 5050 version, adjusted RGB vallues correctly.
1.3) Fixed several incorrect values, the numbering on some template RGB values were incorrectly adjusted. Added a 10XX version.


 ||============================||
||  -Which version to choose?-  ||

-- All more bright : Pick the 4040 version --

-- All brightest : Pick the 5050 version --



-- Homes&Shops Brighter/Dungeons a little brighter : Pick the 2010 version (this means dungeons are still a little brighter than standard LUX, same value as 1010)--

-- Homes&Shops Bright/Dungeons a little brighter: Pick the 3010 version (this means dungeons are still a little brighter than standard LUX, same value as 1010)--

-- Only Homes&Shops a little brighter: Pick the 10XX Version (Dungeons have standard LUX brightness)--

 Pick the file like explained above and simply drag it into your favorite mod manager.

 
The compatibility patches from LUX still work as those patches do not adress the light templates. 
They mostly fix lightbulb placement as far as I understand (probably more but not the thing which was editted) Meaning that it  should work.
