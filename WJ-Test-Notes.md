# About FUS

## Profiles
The list comes with 3 profiles:
+ FUS - Just the fundamental mods for a good VR experience that is also intended as a starting point for others to mod start modding from.
+ FUS RO - Same as FUS, but also comes with a visual upgrade
+ FUS RO DAH - Same as above, but also contains tons of optoinal game play changes.

FUS RO DAH is the default profile, and all mods are active by default. Users can easily deactivate any optional mods they do not want, as long as they are marked as optional.

## There is no GFF
In FUS, we use an ENB manager to move what would normally go into the GFF step. This way, users can toggle on and off the esstinal files, but it also makes it easier to choose between open composite, FSR or steamVR. Essential files and "update skyrim.ini" must be activated on install.

## Optional mods
If a user deslect an optional mod, then the mod won't be removed from the plugins list. We have placeholder plugins that kick in if a mod is deselected. This way, load order is perserved, regardless of which optional mods are chosen.

## ENB or ReShade?
The modlist is mostly intended to use with VrVision, but also works quite well with Sensorium ENB.

## Lots of disabled mods
Category Late Load and DO NOT TOUCH contians disable mods. That is because those mods are merged into "GeneralFixesAndCR" to save plugin space.
