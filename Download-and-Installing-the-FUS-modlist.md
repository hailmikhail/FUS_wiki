# Downloading and Installing

Create a new folder on the root of your gaming drive, the drive where you want everything to be installed. Name it "FUS".

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD. We highly recommend getting Nexus premium membership to automate the download process.


1. Download the latest FUS release from here:
https://github.com/Kvitekvist/FUS/releases

2. Open Wabbajack:

3. Run the downloaded FUS.wabbajack install file and set the installation folder to the folder you just created. The downloads path should automatically fill in the installation path.

4. Click the Go/Begin button
5. Wait for Wabbajack to finish
