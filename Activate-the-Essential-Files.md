# Activate the Essential Files

This step will add the required files for SKSE, Engine Fixes, DLL loader and other essential files that cannot be handled by MO2.

DO NOT RUN LOOT! Everytime you run LOOT a kitten dies and we cry in the corner. The load order is exactly as it should be, do not change it.

First, run the program named Essentials Files from Mod Organizer 2.
If you don't find the Essentials Files in the dropdown, then Wabbajack did not install successfully. Re-run wabbajack and pay attention to errors during install.

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about "Failed to check for update". This is ok.

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

Then you will see this menu and need to first disable all, and then enable like this:

If any options are already checked, then you should first uncheck them (grey) then check the essential files you need. 

Always press the `Sync` button after you change options!

* You must activate the "Essential Files" option. 

### **ALL OTHER OPTIONS ARE OPTIONAL**

* SteamVR - Vanilla SteamVR options, this is the default `openvr_api.dll` file without manipulations.
* OpenComposite - This replaces the SteamVR default `openvr_api.dll` and will give Oculus users a strong performance boost. __FIRST__ _switch off the SteamVR option in that case!_ The files replace each other. IMPORTANT: This will break `Virtual Desktop`, `VR FPS Stabilizer` and `Mage VR`, but the performance boost is worth it for most users.
* VR Performance Toolkit. Read about it here: https://github.com/fholger/vrperfkit
* Real Virtual Magic Libraries - This is needed only if you use the Real Virtual Magic brain-computer interface mod by Cangar.

Always press the `Sync` button after you change options!
