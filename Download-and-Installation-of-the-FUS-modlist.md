# Downloading and Installing

Check and make sure your [PC is prepared for the modlist](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/FUS/wiki/Prepare-PC-for-modlist).

Create a new folder on the root of your gaming drive, the drive where you want everything to be installed. Name it "FUS".

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD. 

We highly recommend getting Nexus premium membership to automate the download process. Otherwise, you will have to click "Download" for each mod.

If this is set, just open Wabbajack and browse the mod lists, you can filter for "FUS" at the top. Press "Download modlist" there. Set the installation location to the FUS folder you just created. The downloads path should automatically fill in the installation path. Click the Go/Begin button.

Wait for Wabbajack to finish. Potentially you need to restart Wabbajack, if it fails first try. This is fine, though, because Wabbajack saves everything even when it crashes :)

If you run into any issues see the [wabbajack troubleshooting page](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/FUS/wiki/Wabbajack-Troubleshooting).
