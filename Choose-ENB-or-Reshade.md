# Choose ENB or Reshade
From MO2, run the ENB \ Reshade program:

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about "Failed to check for update". This is ok.

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

Now here, you can choose from a list of different ENB/Reshade profiles. _Only choose one!_ There are 3 difference performance indicators in their names. Low means low performance cost, Medium means medium performance cost and High means high performance cost. 
If any preset was marked as on, then switch them off, then switch on the selection of your choice. By default, The first option is checked. Uncheck this and then check any of the other options that you would like to test. If you switch options it is automatically synched, but using the synch button does not hurt either.

The best option for low performance impact but high visual gains including a sharp image is the `VRVision` reshade option. The best ENB option for this list is the `Sensorium` ENB which includes a sharpener. The Luminous ENB is also looking nice and the CAS sharpener is included by us. The other ENBs are not explicitly tested but we shipped them for your convenience. Use at your own risk and feel free to give us feedback if you tweaked them to work well with FUS! All options are mutually exclusive, only choose one!

**IMPORTANT:** If you want to use the Sensorium ENB you need to change the ini using Bilago's Tool (start from MO2 in the dropdown): set `bUseFilmicCurve=0`. Probably also a good idea for the other ENBs although they don't explicitly demand it. Don't forget to switch it back on when choosing a Reshade again.

Only choose one option!
