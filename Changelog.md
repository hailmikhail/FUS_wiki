## Version 1.0.1

### Mods added

+ True Storms
+ DummyPlugins (one for each profile, meaning if mods are disabled these plugins will stay and preserve the loadorder)
+ Strange Runes as optional mod
+ Obsidian Mountain Fog
+ FUS_TrueStorm_Patch (also uploaded to Nexus)


### Fixes

+ Profiles are renamed to "FUS", "FUS RO", and "FUS RO DAH"
+ Basic and Basic + Visual profiles are now included. I messed up so WJ only included the main profile FUS RO DAH.
+ Fixed load order of several mods (Synthesis and a few others)
+ Mod Category 3 (orange ones) are all marked as optional mods. Add the ones you want, you do not need all. But see if you also need any of the patches.
+ Added a "restore" backup of mod order and load order, in case you mess it up. Now you can click on the restore button in MO2, to restore the list back to default sorting.
+ Iron starting gear is removed from character creation.

### Mods removed

- Spellforge - Vokrii patch (there was no patch for this)

### Important note about Load Order
You can activate or deactivate any mod marked as optional. Load order will be preserved. DO NOT RUN LOOT. If you add mods yourself, sort them manually. Best general tip is to have the plugins sorted in the same order as the mods. There are exceptions, so this is a general advice.

### Tools are missing?
We have decided not to include most of the tools we use when developing the modlist. This is not because we don't want to share how we do things. In fact we added all this in the readme above. We have excluded the tools because if a tool hosted on GIT is updated the list goes down which is a typical Dyndolod issue. LOOT is removed because running it will break the modlist. 

We are also continuously working on improving the readme!
