# The full modlist

**Select the profile of your choice!** 

- The green parts are really the mods that we think no Skyrim VR mod list should be without.
- The blue parts contain a selection of audio/visual/architecture/armory/NPC overhauls that we think is fine to work as standalone. This is personal preference and just a selection we made and like.
- The yellow parts are our choice of gameplay improvements/changes. These deviate from vanilla and mostly make the game more interesting and challenging, or just overall improve the feeling. Obviously, these are personal preference, too.
- The optional LOD files contain DynDoLOD generated files that enhance the visuals in the distance. These cost performance but make a big difference!
- The red late load parts contain patches that we created for this mod list. Use them if you use the respective mods above. We appreciate an endorsement! :)
- Surprise: **DO NOT TOUCH** the files that are marked as such. 

So, here's the full list:
