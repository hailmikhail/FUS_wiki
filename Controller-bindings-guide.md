# Controller bindings guide





No matter the controller binding you use inside Skyrim, if you use the Valve Index controllers you need to enable the VRIK SteamVR bindings **in addition**: Navigate to your SteamVR Settings -> Devices -> Controller Settings.  Click on Manage Controller Bindings.  Select The Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimVR from the drop down list.  Click "Edit this Binding" (you may need to click the "Custom" button to make it appear).  A new window will pop up.  You may need to click Back in the top-left.  Make sure it shows your Index Controllers as the Current Controller - Change it if necessary.  A list of Community bindings should become visible.  Find and select the "VRIK Index Controller Bindings V2.1.0" in the list.  Be careful not to select the older V1.0.0 or V2.0.0 bindings by mistake, as this will not work.  Selecting the VRIK Index Controller Bindings V2.1.0 here will complete the process. This can also be done when the game was already started from inside the SteamVR settings menu in VR.

Note: Always remember to turn on your Index controllers before starting SkyrimVR, or you will encounter game breaking bugs. 



In [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OU6kbtt-jNQ8sL8d-URMuNa-r1-kKJbJHt0dHE-VpU) I explain the controller mappings in more detail so you can change to whatever you wish if you want.
